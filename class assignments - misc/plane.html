        <h6>STIX</h6>
        <p>a bunch of gibberish that doesn't necessarily matter all that much.
        i'm just writing a bunch of nonsense to fill up space and to make it look
        more proffesional than it really is. so far, this doesn't look all that great,
        but i'm hoping that by the end, it'll look somewhat okay. i have no capitalization
        for aesthetic.</p>

        <h6>TAXII</h6>
        <p>some more nonsense that doesn't make sense whatsoever. just typing away to fill
        up space like the paragraph before. somehow i hope to make the two paragraphs appear
        side by side. i think i have to use flexbox or something, which was really confusing
        the last time i had to do that. more words, more meaningless sentences that just take
        up space.</p>
