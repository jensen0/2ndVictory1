            <h2>Soccer</h2>
              <p>Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball.
               It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a 
               rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.</p>

            <h2>Baseball</h2>
            <p>Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding.
                 The batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball (that is thrown by the opposing team's pitcher) with a bat swung by the batter,
                  and then running counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances 
                  around the bases and returns to home plate.</p>

            <h2>Basketball</h2>
            <p>Basketball is a limited contact sport played on a rectangular court. 
                While most often played as a team sport with five players on each side, 
                three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one competitions are also common. 
                The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter and 10 feet 
                (3.048 m) high that is mounted to a backboard at each end of the court. The game was invented in 1891 by 
                Dr. James Naismith, who would be the first basketball coach of the Kansas Jayhawks, one of the most successful 
                programs in the game's history.</p>
